# bookmark-landing-page
A landing bookmark page, also a big milestone for me, as it marks my second intermediate project from frontendmentor.io

Worth noting is that there is too many little details / especially going from desktop to phone size -
Generally speaking I should have approached the design completely different, set up some variables for colors, font, displays etc,
but since I am not familiar with that yet, I basically just coded each individually while trying to re-use some of the classes.
Will try to be more careful next time for my, readability, and possibly maintaining sake!
